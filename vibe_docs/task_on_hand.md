# üéØ Current Task: Time Travel Debugger for JavaScript

_Started: 2025-01-27_
_Status: üöÄ SETUP PHASE - Environment Setup & Initial Development_

## üìã PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

### Project Name
**Time Travel Debugger for JavaScript** (using deno_core)

### Project Description
A toy implementation of a time-travel debugger for JavaScript to learn how these kinds of debuggers work. The debugger will:
- Execute JavaScript code using deno_core (V8 engine)
- Hook into execution state in a Rust program
- Capture snapshots of execution state
- Allow navigation backward and forward through execution history
- Provide debugging interface to inspect variables at any point in time

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Learning/educational use for understanding time-travel debugging concepts
- **Secondary**: Potential foundation for more advanced debugging tools

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Successfully execute JavaScript code via deno_core in Rust
- [ ] Capture execution state snapshots at function boundaries
- [ ] Navigate backward/forward through execution timeline
- [ ] Inspect variable values at any captured point
- [ ] Demonstrate working time-travel debugging on simple JavaScript programs

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Technology Stack
- **Core Language**: Rust 1.80.0+
- **JavaScript Engine**: deno_core 0.311+ (V8 bindings)
- **Async Runtime**: tokio (for event loop)
- **State Storage**: In-memory for MVP, potentially SQLite later
- **Interface**: CLI for MVP, potential web interface later

### Architecture Components
1. **JavaScript Execution Engine**: deno_core runtime integration
2. **State Capture System**: Hook into V8 execution to record snapshots
3. **Time Navigation**: Forward/backward movement through execution
4. **State Storage**: Efficient storage of execution snapshots
5. **Debug Interface**: CLI for querying state at any point

### Development Environment
- **OS**: macOS 24.5.0 (development), cross-platform target
- **Tools**: Rust/Cargo, VS Code, Git
- **Dependencies**: deno_core, tokio, serde, anyhow
