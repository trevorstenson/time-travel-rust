## 2025-01-27 - Phase 1.2 Completion: Basic Execution Monitoring ‚úÖ

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ **PHASE 1.2 COMPLETED - BASIC EXECUTION MONITORING**

**üéØ ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- Successfully implemented function entry/exit detection using V8 operations
- Created enhanced execution monitoring with proper timing and context capture
- Built structured execution trace output with nested call tracking
- Implemented manual instrumentation API for JavaScript functions

**üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- **Added V8 Operations**: 
  - `op_function_entry(name)` - Track function calls
  - `op_function_exit(name, duration_ms)` - Track function exits with timing
  - `op_capture_execution_context(type, data)` - Capture execution context
- **Enhanced JavaScript Runtime**: Updated `timeDebugger` global API with monitoring capabilities
- **Execution State Tracking**: Added comprehensive `ExecutionState` struct with call history and statistics
- **Function Call Instrumentation**: Built framework for manual and automatic function monitoring

**üß™ TESTING RESULTS:**
- ‚úÖ Manual monitoring test passes completely
- ‚úÖ Function entry/exit tracking working with proper indentation
- ‚úÖ Execution timing captured with millisecond precision
- ‚úÖ Context capture system functional with structured data
- ‚úÖ Nested function calls properly tracked and displayed

**üìä PERFORMANCE:**

- Context capture working with complex nested objects
- Execution tracing shows proper call hierarchy

**üé¨ DEMO OUTPUT SAMPLE:**
```
üîç ENTER: outerFunction
üîç ENTER: innerFunction
üîç EXIT:  innerFunction (0.007ms)
üîç EXIT:  outerFunction (0.053ms)
üì∏ CONTEXT: test_context -> {"message": "test", "data": {...}}
```

**üöÄ NEXT STEPS:**
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2: State Capture Foundation

## 2025-01-27 - CRITICAL BUG FIX: V8 Ops State Synchronization ‚úÖ

**STATUS**: üêõ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED - EXECUTION STATE TRACKING**

**üö® PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**
- User reported `basic_functions.js` showing "0 total function calls" despite having multiple functions
- Discovered V8 operations were not updating Rust-side ExecutionState
- Manual monitoring API working but state tracking completely broken

**üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- V8 operations (`op_function_entry`, `op_function_exit`) were static functions printing to console only
- No connection between JavaScript calls and Rust ExecutionState tracking
- `ExecutionState::log_function_entry()` method was never being called
- Result: Perfect console output but zero state updates

**üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL SOLUTION:**
1. **Shared State via OpState**: Used `Rc<RefCell<ExecutionState>>` to share state between runtime and V8 ops
2. **Operation State Access**: Modified V8 ops to accept `&mut OpState` parameter
3. **Proper Borrow Management**: Fixed RefCell borrow checker issues with scoped borrowing
4. **State Synchronization**: Connected JavaScript monitoring calls to Rust execution tracking

**üíª KEY CODE CHANGES:**
```rust
// Runtime Setup - Store shared state in OpState
let execution_state = Rc::new(RefCell::new(ExecutionState::default()));
js_runtime.op_state().borrow_mut().put(execution_state.clone());

// V8 Operations - Access shared state
#[op2(fast)]
fn op_function_entry(state: &mut OpState, #[string] name: String) {
    if let Some(execution_state) = state.try_borrow_mut::<Rc<RefCell<ExecutionState>>>() {
        execution_state.borrow_mut().log_function_entry(name, vec![], None, None);
    }
}
```

**üß™ BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON:**
- **Before**: `Total function calls: 0` (broken state tracking)
- **After**: `Total function calls: 4` with full statistics and timeline

**‚úÖ VERIFICATION RESULTS:**
```
üîç EXECUTION TRACE:
Total function calls: 4
Max call depth reached: 2

üìä FUNCTION CALL STATISTICS:
  testFunction ‚Üí 1 calls
  contextTest ‚Üí 1 calls
  innerFunction ‚Üí 1 calls
  outerFunction ‚Üí 1 calls

üïê FUNCTION CALL TIMELINE:
  1: testFunction()
  2: outerFunction()
  3:   innerFunction()
  4: contextTest()
```

**üîß ADDITIONAL FIXES:**
- Fixed RefCell borrow checker error with proper scoping
- Updated CLI to handle new Rc<RefCell<>> state access pattern
- Added comprehensive error documentation in troubleshooting.md

**üìö LESSONS LEARNED:**
- V8 operations need explicit state sharing via OpState
- RefCell requires careful borrow scope management
- Always verify end-to-end state updates, not just console output
- Manual testing with multiple patterns reveals state sync issues

**üéØ IMPACT:**
- Manual monitoring now fully functional with complete state tracking
- Foundation ready for Phase 2 (State Capture) implementation
- Demonstrates monitoring infrastructure working correctly
- Clear path forward for automatic function detection (Phase 1.3)

**üîß FILES MODIFIED:**
- `src/runtime/engine.rs`: Shared state architecture, fixed borrow management
- `src/cli/mod.rs`: Updated state access for Rc<RefCell<>> pattern
- `vibe_docs/troubleshooting.md`: Added borrow checker and OpState patterns
- `vibe_docs/task_on_hand.md`: Clarified manual vs automatic monitoring status
