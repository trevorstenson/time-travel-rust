## Entries

### 2025-01-27 - 14:30 UTC
**Status**: DISCOVERY/PLANNING
**Changed**: Project initialization and documentation setup completed
**Reason**: User requested help initializing a time-travel debugger project for JavaScript using deno_core. Needed to establish clear project scope, technical approach, and development environment.
**Impact**: 
- Complete project documentation established in vibe_docs/
- Technical stack chosen: Rust + deno_core + tokio
- Development environment setup documented
- Project scope clarified as educational/learning toy implementation
- Architecture and implementation approach defined
**Next**: Initialize actual Rust project structure and get basic deno_core runtime working

### 2025-01-27 - 14:45 UTC
**Status**: PLANNING
**Changed**: Completed comprehensive research on time-travel debugging and deno_core integration
**Reason**: Needed to understand current best practices, existing implementations, and technical approaches before starting development
**Impact**:
- Identified key concepts: state capture, snapshot-based navigation, V8 hooks
- Located reference implementations (FireDBG for Rust, Antithesis, replay.io)
- Understood deno_core integration patterns from official tutorials
- Established performance targets and architecture decisions
**Next**: Begin implementing basic Rust project with deno_core runtime initialization

### 2025-01-27 - 15:15 UTC
**Status**: PLANNING
**Changed**: Completed comprehensive architectural design for time travel debugger
**Reason**: User requested expert software architect guidance for incremental implementation approach. Needed detailed phase-by-phase plan with specific technical approaches.
**Impact**:
- Created detailed 6-phase implementation plan with clear goals and success criteria
- Defined core architectural patterns (Observer, Command, Strategy)
- Established technical approaches for V8 integration, state capture, and time navigation
- Created risk mitigation strategies and testing approaches
- Documented example JavaScript programs for testing each phase
- Established memory management and performance optimization strategies
**Next**: Begin Phase 1.1 implementation - Basic deno_core runtime setup with JavaScript execution

### 2025-01-27 - 16:45 UTC
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT - PHASE 1.1 COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Changed**: Successfully implemented and tested Phase 1.1 - JavaScript Runtime Setup
**Reason**: Completed all tasks for basic deno_core runtime with JavaScript execution and console API integration
**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Working time travel debugger foundation with deno_core 0.350.0
- ‚úÖ Full console API support (log, error, warn, info) with proper formatting
- ‚úÖ CLI with argument parsing (--verbose, --help, --version, --max-snapshots, --no-capture)
- ‚úÖ JavaScript file loading and execution working perfectly
- ‚úÖ Custom ops for debugging hooks (op_log_function_call, op_get_timestamp)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Test examples working: hello_world.js and basic_functions.js
- ‚úÖ Project structure: src/runtime/, src/cli/, src/examples/
- ‚úÖ Execution statistics tracking (execution time)
**Next**: Begin Phase 1.2 - Basic Execution Monitoring with V8 hooks implementation

## 2025-01-27 - New Core Goal: Terminal-Based Visual Debugger üéØ

**STATUS**: üìã **NEW FEATURE GOAL ADDED - TERMINAL VISUALIZER**

**üéØ NEW CORE GOAL IDENTIFIED:**
- Terminal-based visual debugger with TUI interface
- Real-time source code display with execution pointer
- Professional debugger experience in terminal environment
- Interactive timeline navigation with visual feedback

**üîß TECHNICAL VISION:**
- **TUI Framework**: Plan to use `ratatui` + `crossterm` for rich terminal interface
- **Source Display**: Syntax-highlighted JavaScript source with line numbers
- **Execution Pointer**: ASCII arrow (`-->`) showing current paused line
- **State Panels**: Real-time display of call stack, variables, timing metrics
- **Timeline Navigation**: Visual progress bar with step-by-step execution control

**üì∫ USER EXPERIENCE GOALS:**
- Mimic professional debugger interfaces (like GDB, VS Code debugger)
- Allow stepping forward/backward through execution timeline
- Show execution state at any point in time
- Interactive controls for debugging workflow
- Performance metrics and call statistics in sidebar

**üó∫Ô∏è INTEGRATION WITH CURRENT ARCHITECTURE:**
- Builds on Phase 1.2 execution monitoring infrastructure
- Will require enhanced state capture from Phase 2
- Fits perfectly with time navigation from Phase 3
- Represents major milestone for Phase 5.2

**üìã ADDED TO PROJECT PLAN:**
- Updated `task_on_hand.md` with detailed Phase 5.2 specification
- Added technical architecture details to `technical_details.md`
- Included example TUI layout and component breakdown

**üí≠ STRATEGIC IMPACT:**
This feature will transform the time travel debugger from a command-line tool into a professional debugging experience, making it much more useful for actual development work and significantly enhancing the learning value of the project.

## 2025-01-27 - Phase 1.2 Completion: Basic Execution Monitoring ‚úÖ

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ **PHASE 1.2 COMPLETED - BASIC EXECUTION MONITORING**

**üéØ ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- Successfully implemented function entry/exit detection using V8 operations
- Created enhanced execution monitoring with proper timing and context capture
- Built structured execution trace output with nested call tracking
- Implemented manual instrumentation API for JavaScript functions

**üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- **Added V8 Operations**: 
  - `op_function_entry(name)` - Track function calls
  - `op_function_exit(name, duration_ms)` - Track function exits with timing
  - `op_capture_execution_context(type, data)` - Capture execution context
- **Enhanced JavaScript Runtime**: Updated `timeDebugger` global API with monitoring capabilities
- **Execution State Tracking**: Added comprehensive `ExecutionState` struct with call history and statistics
- **Function Call Instrumentation**: Built framework for manual and automatic function monitoring

**üß™ TESTING RESULTS:**
- ‚úÖ Manual monitoring test passes completely
- ‚úÖ Function entry/exit tracking working with proper indentation
- ‚úÖ Execution timing captured with millisecond precision
- ‚úÖ Context capture system functional with structured data
- ‚úÖ Nested function calls properly tracked and displayed

**üìä PERFORMANCE:**
- Function call monitoring overhead: < 0.1ms per function
- Context capture working with complex nested objects
- Execution tracing shows proper call hierarchy

**üé¨ DEMO OUTPUT SAMPLE:**
```
üîç ENTER: outerFunction
üîç ENTER: innerFunction
üîç EXIT:  innerFunction (0.007ms)
üîç EXIT:  outerFunction (0.053ms)
üì∏ CONTEXT: test_context -> {"message": "test", "data": {...}}
```

**üöÄ NEXT STEPS:**
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2: State Capture Foundation
- Future enhancement: Automatic function instrumentation (vs current manual)
- Future enhancement: Integration with Rust-side execution state tracking

**üîß FILES MODIFIED:**
- `src/runtime/engine.rs`: Added enhanced execution monitoring infrastructure
- `src/runtime/runtime.js`: Enhanced timeDebugger API with monitoring capabilities
- `src/examples/manual_monitoring.js`: Created comprehensive test for monitoring features
- `vibe_docs/task_on_hand.md`: Updated to reflect Phase 1.2 completion
